# Phase 1: Python and Django

## Preparing the test case

First we need to set up a Django installation that we can use for our sample application.

```bash
$ pip install Django==5.0.7
````

```bash
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

```bash
$ django-admin startproject phase_1 .
$ python manage.py migrate
```
